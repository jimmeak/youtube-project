# Youtube Project

This project is starting as a project where 
coworkers can learn basics of PHP and how to
use some architecture patterns for web design.

## Getting Started

We need docker to run this app. It is also
good to have installed PHP 8.3 and Composer 2.
To run autoloader, we need to run composer
```shell
composer dump-autoload
```

Next step is to run docker compose and run
the apache container
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
